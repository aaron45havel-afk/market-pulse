# BACKLOG.md

Out-of-scope items spotted while working a phase. Add, keep going, do not detour.

Format: `- [PHASE-SEEN] item — why it matters`

---

## Open

- [P0] Postgres row-level security for `mf_*` tables — ARCHITECTURE.md §2 uses a
  repository layer plus a route-enumeration test instead, because the app connects as a
  single DB user with per-call connections and no session context. RLS is the stronger
  guarantee and should replace it once connection handling supports `SET LOCAL`.
- [P0] `PyMuPDF>=1.24.0` is the only unpinned dependency in `requirements.txt` —
  reproducibility gap.
- [P0] No standalone test-on-push CI workflow. The 22 suites run only inside the
  data-refresh Actions, so a PR touching domain logic is not gated on them.
- [P0] `market-pulse-v21/main.py` is ~5,900 lines. Existing routes are out of scope for
  this build, but the file is past the point of comfortable review.
- [P0] `focusedops-site/` is an unrelated static one-pager sharing this repo. Not
  load-bearing here; worth splitting out eventually.
- [P0] The existing analysis app stores money as `DOUBLE PRECISION` and gates access
  per-route. Acceptable for public-filing analysis, out of scope to retrofit, but it
  means two conventions live in one process — see ARCHITECTURE.md §2.
- [P0] `refresh_compounders.py` writes a wrong `price` for some tickers (Booking
  Holdings at 0.8x P/FCF, Trade Desk at $13.80). Guarded on `/holt`, unfixed at source,
  and every board reading `pfcf_now` is affected.
- [P0] `CRON_SECRET` was exposed in an earlier session and has not been rotated.
- [P0] `refresh-quiet-value.yml` has never once succeeded (all 9 runs since it shipped
  on 2026-08-09, weekly on Saturdays, are `failure` or `cancelled`). Root cause per the
  2026-09-12 run log: both price sources it can reach from a GitHub-hosted runner are
  unusable — Stooq answers with a JS bot-check page, Yahoo returns HTTP 429 on every
  request. The circuit breaker added in #214 is working as designed (refuses to write a
  short board rather than publish broken data), so the page correctly shows "no data"
  instead of garbage, but the quiet-value screen has never had live numbers. Needs a
  price source reachable from Actions runners (a keyed API, or routing through a proxy)
  — a data-source/vendor decision, not a code fix.
